# GDRR-2BP ![workflow](https://github.com/JeroenGar/gdrr-2bp/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

** work in progress **

A Rust implementation
of [a goal-driven ruin and recreate heuristic for the 2D variable-sized bin packing problem with guillotine constraints]( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221721009826).

The code used for the experiments in the paper was originally written in Java. 
This code can, due to contractual requirements, unfortunately not be made public.

However, this reimplementation in Rust closely resembles the original design philosophy and datastructures.
It is also multiple times faster than the Java implementation.

More information coming soon.
